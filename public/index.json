As computer-based research has increased in complexity, so have the challenges of ensuring that this research is reproducible. To address this challenge, we review the concept of the research compendium as a solution for providing a standard and easily recognizable way for organizing the digital materials of a research project to enable other researchers to inspect, reproduce, and extend the research. We investigate how the structure and tooling of software packages of the R programming language are being used to produce research compendia in a variety of disciplines. We also describe how software engineering tools and services are being used by researchers to streamline working with research compendia. Using real-world examples, we show how researchers can improve the reproducibility of their work using research compendia based on R packages and related tools.","tags":[""],"title":"Packaging Data Analytical Work Reproducibly Using R (and Friends)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas Kluyver","Benjamin Ragan-Kelley","Fernando Pérez","Brian Granger","Matthias Bussonnier","Jonathan Frederic","Kyle Kelley","Jessica Hamrick","Jason Grout","Sylvain Corlay","Paul Ivanov","Damián Avila","Safia Abdalla","Carol Willing","Jupyter Development Team"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573781698,"objectID":"a783bd9c19a3e6f162b6370504d4579f","permalink":"/publication/kluyver_et_al/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kluyver_et_al/","section":"publication","summary":"It is increasingly necessary for researchers in all fields to write computer code, and in order to reproduce research results, it is important that this code is published.
