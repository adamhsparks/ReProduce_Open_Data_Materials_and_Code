In this session [@fgacenga](https://github.com/fgacenga) and [@adamhsparks](https://github.com/adamhsparks) will lead you through how to make your research data, materials and code open. We will have presentations on [FAIR data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/fairdata), using tools such as [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for organising your materials and [GitHub](https://www.github.com/), [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product), [Zenodo](https://www.zenodo.org/) and [OSF](https://osf.io/) for sharing them openly.

We have created this website using these tools [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

All of the code are available from Adam's GitHub, <https://github.com/adamhsparks/ReProduce_Open_Data_Materials_and_Code>.
