Repository for the [re:produce workshop](https://aas.eventsair.com/reproduce-workshop/) workshop's [website](https://re-produce-opendatamaterialscode.netlify.com/) on Open Data, Materials and Code organised by [@fgacenga](https://github.com/fgacenga) and [@adamhsparks](https://github.com/adamhsparks).

This workshop introduces how you can make your research data, materials and code open and available. We intend to introduce the concept of a research compendium as a means to ensure that these these goals are met and why you would want to share your materials openly. To help familiriase participants, information on [FAIR data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/fairdata), using tools such as [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for organising your materials and [GitHub](https://www.github.com/), [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product), [Figshare](https://www.figshare.com/), [Zenodo](https://www.zenodo.org/), [OSF](https://osf.io/) and others for sharing them openly will be presented.

The main presentation will be delivered by Associate Professor Emerson M. Del Ponte, [@edelponte](https://www.twitter.com/edelponte/), from [Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa (UFV)](https://www.ufv.br) Brazil on his experiences using research compendia and pre-prints for making data, materials and code open and available.

A panel discussion will include Dr. Francis Gacenga, A/Prof Adam H. Sparks, A/Prof Emerson M. Del Ponte and Ms Belinda Weaver ([Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au)), [@cloudaus](https://www.twitter.com/cloudaus).

Attendees will then have the opportunity to create a research compendium using OSF](https://osf.io/) using either their own materials, or a set of materials provided by us for this exercise.

By the end of this workshop users will have learned what tools are available to make their research data, materials and code open and available. To aid in this, we have put together a website with more information from the workshop with further suggested reading on the topic of research compendia and other resources that can be useful for participants to refer to, https://re-produce-opendatamaterialscode.netlify.com/.

We have created this website using these tools: [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), [GitHub](https://www.github.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and released it under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License, these materials are available through OSF, [DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/8CSZW](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/8CSZW).

All of the code and materials are available from GitHub, <https://github.com/adamhsparks/ReProduce_Open_Data_Materials_and_Code>.
